Demo codes to test js frameworks
---
There are plenty of javascript frameworks to choose from to develop modern web applications.
I use the word "framework" because, compared to software libraries, a framework modifies how we develop code and how code is organized and drawn.

Exploring the different frameworks available there are a lot of "hello world", easy / fast tutorias, "jsfiddle" codes and "npm hello-word" commands to get started and understand how the framework works.

There are more "complete" tutorials such as the "to-do list", "e-commerce app" ..., simple to understand and run and give more information to those who want to know a framework.

These examples, however, make it clear what a framework can do and the way it works but do not give me an important information such as:

- Can I use HTML in the framework?
- Can I use JS / Jquery code already written?
- How does file organization change in my projects?
- What dependencies and libraries are needed for frameworks?
- Are there any tools I need to install?
- Can I use the "A-framework" toghether with "B-framework" and use "C-library"?

These questions are really important because you don't want wast time to rewrite lot's of js/html codes written in the last 4-years.

JS frameworks that implement the MVC (MVVC) full stack are well know to change your way in coding and how you organize the whole project. This could be difficult to manage if you don't want to start a new project but just upgrade the old one.

I have therefore analyzed several js framework with these attentions in mind and with the intention of using them in a business context where there are projects and piece of codes already realized, needing to have a long-term support, need to work off-line.

The "Sum" hello worls demo I coded and published must complies (and contains) with the following rules:

- Two input box for two variables: A & B
- Labels should be dinamically changed while typing inside input boxes
- A summary is real-time calculated
- All files should be bundled with demo
- Demo works off-line with your web browser
- No server required

### USE:
Just download and open index.html with your preferred browser!

### TODO:
- Add JQuery/JQuery-UI code if possible
