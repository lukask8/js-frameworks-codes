A very simple demo, more then an "Hello world", less then a "todo-list".

Goal:
- Two input box for two variables: A & B
- Labels for A & B should be dinamically changed while typing inside input boxes
- A variable C = A + B is real-time calculated
- All files should be bundled with demo
- Demo works off-line with your web browser, no server or external library required!
- No "scaffold" command. No npm/git/pip/bower required.
