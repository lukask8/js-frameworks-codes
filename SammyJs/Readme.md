## SPA routing demo with Sammy and multiple framework

This is a demo code to test "Sammy" routing.
Sammy calls all "sum demos" I have made and published on root directory.

Goal:
- A simple SPA that links them all!
- All files should be bundled with demo
- Demo works off-line with your web browser
- No server or external library required!
- No "scaffold" command. No npm/git/pip/bower required.


## Todo
- Changes to variable local variables A,B,C should be binded with global variables A,B,C.
- Add React demo
